# Decentralized NFT Marketplace (Front End - Using TheGraph)

The Decentralized NFT Marketplace allows users to buy and sell NFTs. This front end of the Dapp
interacts with the "hardhat-nft-marketplace" repo for backend functionality. Users may also cancel
their listings if they no longer want to sell their NFTs, as well as update pricing if they
choose to do so.

This front end utilizes a TheGraph to keep track of the most recently listed NFTs to showcase
to users viewing the marketplace. IPFS is used for token URI storage.
